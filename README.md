Long project, might be a bit simple in some cases and not perfect - accepting feedback always!!

Utilising what I have learnt about NLP to create a text classifier for Fake VS Factual news
This is my first project on NLP so may get scrapped in the future for a more refined and focused project.

Imported packages include Seaborne, Pandas, Scikit learn and gensim models
incorporated POS tagging, Extracting NER, Text Preprocessing, Tokenizing, Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling
and finally creating our classification model
